# 2.2 What is AI?

- intelligence demonstrated by machines
- that mimic "cognitive" functions
- such as "learning" and "problem solving"
- whatever hasn't been done yet

Can be classified into three different types of systems: 
- Analytical AI
- Human-inspired AI
- Humanized AI

## Analytical AI
- consistent with cognitive intelligence
- using learning based on past experience
- to inform future decisions

## Human-inspired AI
- cognitive and emotional intelligence
- understanding human emotions
- in addition to cognitive elements
- considering them in their decision making

## Humanized AI
- all types of human competencies 
- like cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence
- self-conscious and self-aware

# 2.4 Different Approaches/Methods

## Search and Optimization
- Searching through many possible solutions
- Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
- Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient
- Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size
- Use of Optimization algorithms for effective search

## Logic
- Used for knowledge representation and problem solving
- Propositional logic[190] involves truth functions
- Fuzzy set theory assigns a "degree of truth"
- Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases
- Logic doesn't work in presence of contradictory rules

## Probabilistic Methods
- Operate with incomplete or uncertain information
- Bayesian networks are used for a large number of problems
- Formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive
- Utility is a key concept in science of economics
- How valuable something is to an intelligent agent
- Methods for agent to make choices and plan

## Statistical Learning
- Classifiers and controllers 
- Classification forms a central part of many AI systems
- Many statistical and machine learning approaches
- Performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data
- i.e. size, distribution, dimensionality and level of noise
- kNN, naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM

## Artificial Neural Networks
- Inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain
- Network of connected nodes called artificial neurons
- Input, hidden & output layers
- Use some form of gradient descent on neural topology
- i.e. DNN, CNN, RNN, GAN

# 2.6 Academics Vs Industry

# 2.7 Limitations of AI

## Turing Test
- Interrogator determines computer or human
- Solely based on the responses

## Artificial Brain
- The brain can be simulated by machines 
- Like brain, simulated brains must also be intelligent
- Thus machines can be intelligent

## AI Effect
- Machines are already intelligent
- "real" intelligence is whatever people can do that machines still cannot
- So AI is whatever hasn't been done yet

# 2.8 Disadvantages of AI

## Bias in AI
- AI programs may be programmed to be biased against certain groups
- Researches show that support for AI is higher among men than women
- Data collected may have inherent bias
- Explainable AI is the need of the hour
- COMPAS assigns an exceptionally elevated risk of recidivism to black defendants

## Rise of Unemployment
- Relationship between automation and employment is complicated
- Many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by AI
- While automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs
- Through micro-economic and macro-economic effects
- Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely

## Devaluation of Humanity
- AI cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy
- the use of AI technology in some fields is deeply misguided
- such as customer service or psychotherapy
- AI researchers (and some philosophers) are willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program
- these points suggest that AI research devalues human life

## Autonomous Weapons
- many countries are researching battlefield robots
- United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom
- concerns about risk from superintelligent AI
- want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones

## Threat to Our Existence
-  Many futurists have expressed concerns about it
- Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Elon Musk etc
- AI can evolve to the point that humans could not control it
- But the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity
- Some experts argue that it is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching
