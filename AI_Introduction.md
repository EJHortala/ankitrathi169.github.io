### Please note that this chapter is a general introduction to AI. Rest of the chapters focus on Machine Learning & Deep Learning part for AI.


# 1.1 Why is AI important?
- Impacts Society & Business
- Empowers Better Decisions
- Helps Informed Actions
- Optimizes Operations
- Enables Opportunity Identification
- Redefines Target Audience
- Tests Decisions
- Provides Competitive Advantage
- Improves Communication
- Better Web Searches
- Improves Social Media

# 1.2 What is AI?

- intelligence demonstrated by machines
- that mimic "cognitive" functions
- such as "learning" and "problem solving"
- whatever hasn't been done yet

Can be classified into three different types of systems: 
- Analytical AI
- Human-inspired AI
- Humanized AI

## Analytical AI
- consistent with cognitive intelligence
- using learning based on past experience
- to inform future decisions

## Human-inspired AI
- cognitive and emotional intelligence
- understanding human emotions
- in addition to cognitive elements
- considering them in their decision making

## Humanized AI
- all types of human competencies 
- like cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence
- self-conscious and self-aware

# 1.5 Methods in AI

## Search and Optimization
- Searching through many possible solutions
- Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
- Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient
- Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size
- Use of Optimization algorithms for effective search

## Logic
- Used for knowledge representation and problem solving
- Propositional logic[190] involves truth functions
- Fuzzy set theory assigns a "degree of truth"
- Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases
- Logic doesn't work in presence of contradictory rules

## Probabilistic Methods
- Operate with incomplete or uncertain information
- Bayesian networks are used for a large number of problems
- Formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive
- Utility is a key concept in science of economics
- How valuable something is to an intelligent agent
- Methods for agent to make choices and plan

## Statistical Learning
- Classifiers and controllers 
- Classification forms a central part of many AI systems
- Many statistical and machine learning approaches
- Performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data
- i.e. size, distribution, dimensionality and level of noise
- kNN, naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM

## Artificial Neural Networks
- Inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain
- Network of connected nodes called artificial neurons
- Input, hidden & output layers
- Use some form of gradient descent on neural topology
- i.e. DNN, CNN, RNN, GAN

# 1.6 Limitations of AI

## Turing Test
- Interrogator determines computer or human
- Solely based on the responses

## Artificial Brain
- The brain can be simulated by machines 
- Like brain, simulated brains must also be intelligent
- Thus machines can be intelligent

## AI Effect
- Machines are already intelligent
- "real" intelligence is whatever people can do that machines still cannot
- So AI is whatever hasn't been done yet
