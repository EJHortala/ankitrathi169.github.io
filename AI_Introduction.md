# 1.2 What is AI?

- intelligence demonstrated by machines
- that mimic "cognitive" functions
- such as "learning" and "problem solving"
- whatever hasn't been done yet

Can be classified into three different types of systems: 
- Analytical AI
- Human-inspired AI
- Humanized AI

## Analytical AI
- consistent with cognitive intelligence
- using learning based on past experience
- to inform future decisions

## Human-inspired AI
- cognitive and emotional intelligence
- understanding human emotions
- in addition to cognitive elements
- considering them in their decision making

## Humanized AI
- all types of human competencies 
- like cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence
- self-conscious and self-aware
